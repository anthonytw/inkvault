# InkVault on-disk format, version 1

Normative. Changes to this file are format changes and need a version bump
or a documented compatible extension.

## 1. Vault layout

A vault is a directory whose name ends in `.inkvault`.

```
Notes.inkvault/
  vault.json                              plaintext manifest (§2)
  keys/
    <recipient>.key.age                   optional passphrase-wrapped identity (§3)
  notes/
    <noteId>/
      <hlc>-<device>-<seq>.delta.age      append-only revision (§5)
      <hlc>-<device>-<seq>.snapshot.age   append-only snapshot  (§5)
```

Everything under `notes/` is written once and never modified. The only
exception is a recipient change (§3.3), which rewrites files in place.

Unknown files and directories must be ignored, never deleted.

## 2. vault.json

```json
{
  "format": "inkvault/1",
  "vaultId": "0d1c6a1e-9a44-4a6c-8a6b-0e2a0e9b1f3c",
  "created": "2026-10-04T16:20:00Z",
  "recipients": [
    { "key": "age1ql3z7hjy54pw3hyww5ayyfg7zqgvc7w3j2elw8zmrj2kg5sfn9aqmcac8p",
      "label": "Anthony's iPad", "added": "2026-10-04T16:20:00Z" }
  ],
  "vaultSecret": "-----BEGIN AGE ENCRYPTED FILE-----\n...\n-----END AGE ENCRYPTED FILE-----\n"
}
```

- `recipients[].key`: age X25519 recipient (Bech32, HRP `age`). At least one.
- `vaultSecret`: 32 random bytes, age-encrypted and armored, to exactly the
  listed recipients. It keys the inner authentication tag (§4) and nothing
  else. It is rotated whenever a recipient is removed.

## 3. Keys

### 3.1 Identity

An age X25519 identity, Bech32 with HRP `AGE-SECRET-KEY-`, exactly as
`age-keygen` produces. The corresponding recipient is derived from it.

### 3.2 Passphrase-wrapped identity file

`keys/<recipient>.key.age` is an age file encrypted with a single scrypt
(passphrase) recipient. Its plaintext is an `age-keygen` style file:

```
# created: 2026-10-04T16:20:00Z
# public key: age1ql3z7hjy54pw3hyww5ayyfg7zqgvc7w3j2elw8zmrj2kg5sfn9aqmcac8p
AGE-SECRET-KEY-1QGFZ...
```

`age -d keys/<recipient>.key.age` with the passphrase must work. Writers
use an scrypt work factor between 15 and 18; readers must accept any work
factor up to 20, may accept up to 22, and may refuse larger with an error.
The reader cap exists because scrypt at work factor w needs 2^w × 1 KiB of
memory (20 → 1 GiB, 22 → 4 GiB), beyond what the iPad target can allocate.

The file is optional. A vault may be used with an identity that is only
in a device Keychain or supplied externally.

### 3.3 Changing recipients

Adding a recipient: append it to `recipients`, re-encrypt `vaultSecret`
to the new set, then re-encrypt every file under `notes/` to the new set
(new file key and header). Removing a recipient: the same, with a freshly
generated `vaultSecret`. These are the only in-place rewrites in the format;
do them from one device while others are idle.

In both cases the `gzip(JSON)` bytes of every body (§4) are unchanged. On
removal each body is also re-tagged under the new `vaultSecret`, after its
existing tag has been verified under the outgoing secret. A file whose tag
does not verify is left as it is and reported; it is never re-tagged.

#### 3.3.1 Resumable procedure

Implementations SHOULD change recipients as follows, so that an interrupted
change can be finished by any device holding an identity of the new set:

1. Write `rewrap-journal.json` at the vault root (atomically):

   ```json
   { "format": "inkvault/1",
     "previousVaultSecret": "-----BEGIN AGE ENCRYPTED FILE-----\n...\n" }
   ```

   - `format`: `inkvault/1`.
   - `previousVaultSecret`: present only when the secret is rotated
     (removal): the outgoing 32-byte vault secret, age-encrypted and
     armored to the **new** recipient set. Absent when adding.
2. Write `vault.json` with the new `recipients` and `vaultSecret`.
3. For every file under `notes/`, skip it if it is already complete (below);
   otherwise rewrite it as described above, verifying its tag under the
   current secret or, failing that, under `previousVaultSecret`, and replace
   it atomically (temporary file in the same directory, then rename).
4. Delete `rewrap-journal.json`.

A file is complete when its age header has exactly one `X25519` stanza per
current recipient (and no other stanzas) and its tag verifies under the
current `vaultSecret`. X25519 stanzas do not name their recipient, so this
count is the only header-level check; while a journal exists no other
recipient change is started, so counts from two changes never mix.

If `rewrap-journal.json` exists when a vault is opened, the change is
unfinished: a writer finishes steps 3 and 4 before any other recipient
change, and may verify tags under `previousVaultSecret` meanwhile. Readers
that do not implement this procedure treat the journal as an unknown file
(§1).

## 4. Encrypted file bodies

Every `.age` file under `notes/` is an age v1 file whose plaintext is:

| Offset | Size | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 4 | ASCII `INKV` |
| 4 | 1 | body version, `0x01` |
| 5 | 32 | HMAC-SHA256 tag (below) |
| 37 | rest | `gzip(JSON)` (§5), gzip framing so `gunzip` reads it |

Tag = HMAC-SHA256(key = vaultSecret,
message = `"inkvault/1" ‖ 0x00 ‖ noteId ‖ 0x00 ‖ filename ‖ 0x00 ‖ gzipBytes`),
where `filename` is the file's base name (e.g. `00017596...-a1b2c3d4-12.delta.age`)
and `noteId` is the note directory name. Binding the file name stops a
revision being replayed under another note or name.

Readers must verify the tag when the vault secret is available and must
report, not silently drop, files that fail. Recovery without the app:

```
age -d -i key.txt FILE.age | tail -c +38 | gunzip | jq .
```

## 5. Revisions

Each file under `notes/<noteId>/` is one revision. Name:

```
<hlc>-<device>-<seq>.<delta|snapshot>.age
```

- `hlc`: hybrid logical clock, 17 ASCII digits: 13-digit Unix milliseconds
  followed by a 4-digit counter, both zero-padded. Lexicographic order of
  `hlc` is causal-ish time order. The clock follows the usual HLC rules:
  on every local event or received revision, `millis = max(wall, seen)`,
  counter increments on ties and resets otherwise. A device does not adopt
  a received `hlc` more than 24 hours ahead of its own wall clock; such a
  revision still merges using its `hlc` exactly as written.
- `device`: 8 lowercase hex chars, random per app installation. Never a
  hardware identifier.
- `seq`: per (note, device) counter, decimal, starting at 1, gap-free.
  A writer chooses `seq` greater than every `seq` for its device that
  appears in a file name of the note or is covered by any snapshot's
  `included` (§5.3), so a seq whose file was compacted away is never reused.

Ordering key for anything that needs a total order: `(hlc, device, seq)`.

A reader must reject a revision whose JSON `noteId`, `device`, `seq` or
`hlc` (§5.1) disagree with its directory name or file name, and report it
like any other unreadable file.

### 5.1 Common fields

```json
{
  "type": "delta",
  "noteId": "…",
  "device": "a1b2c3d4",
  "seq": 12,
  "hlc": "17596320000000003",
  "wall": "2026-10-04T16:20:00.123Z",
  "app": "inkvault-ios/0.1"
}
```

`wall` is informational (history UI). `app` is informational.

### 5.2 Delta

Adds `"ops": [Op, ...]`, applied in order. Ops:

| op | fields | effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `addStroke` | `page`, `stroke` | add stroke to page (no-op if page removed) |
| `removeStroke` | `page`, `strokeId` | remove stroke; wins over any add |
| `addPage` | `page: {id, order}` | add an empty page |
| `removePage` | `pageId` | remove page and its strokes; wins over adds |
| `setPageOrder` | `pageId`, `order` | LWW on the page's order key |
| `setMeta` | `field`, `value` | LWW per field (§5.4) |
| `deleteNote` | | LWW with `restoreNote` on `deleted` |
| `restoreNote` | | |

The LWW timestamp of an op is the revision's `(hlc, device)`. `addPage`
adds the page empty; strokes go in `addStroke` ops. A stroke id is never
added again after it has been removed; a writer that undoes an erase, or
restores from history, must mint a new id and may set `parent` to the old
one. The same holds for page ids.

### 5.3 Snapshot

Adds:

```json
"included": { "a1b2c3d4": { "upTo": 12, "extra": [15, 16] },
              "99ee00ff": { "upTo": 3,  "extra": [] } },
"state": State
```

`included` names every revision the snapshot already reflects: for each
device, all `seq ≤ upTo` plus the listed `extra` (seen out of order).
`included` must list only deltas the snapshot applied in full: a delta with
an `addStroke` or `setPageOrder` naming a page the writer has not seen is
left out, so it is applied again once the page arrives. (Removals of unseen
ids are recorded as tombstones instead, §5.4.)

Readers reconstruct a note as the merge of every snapshot present plus every
delta not covered by any snapshot's `included`. Pages and strokes merge as
sets: an item is present if some snapshot holds it or an uncovered delta adds
it, unless a tombstone or an uncovered remove names it, its page is gone, or
some snapshot covers the revision in its `origin` (§5.5, §5.6) but does not
hold it. Metadata, page order and `deleted` merge by LWW, using each
snapshot's recorded clocks and each delta op's own timestamp.
Reconstruction is order-independent: the same set of revisions gives the
same state whatever order they are read in, and implementations must have a
test that reconstructs from shuffled revision orders and compares.

A device may write a snapshot at any time. A delta may be deleted when at
least one snapshot covers it and it is older than the retention window
(default 30 days by `wall`). A snapshot may be deleted when another
snapshot's `included` is a superset of its `included` and it is older than
the window; of two snapshots with equal `included`, keep at least one.

### 5.4 State and metadata

```json
{
  "deleted": false,
  "meta": {
    "title": "Lecture 3",
    "tags": ["math", "fall"],
    "notebook": "School",
    "favorite": false,
    "created": "2026-10-04T16:20:00Z",
    "paper": { "kind": "ruled", "spacing": 24,
               "background": "#FFFFFFFF", "lineColor": "#D0D8E8FF" },
    "pageSize": { "width": 612, "height": 792, "infinite": false }
  },
  "pages": [ Page, ... ]
}
```

- `created` is set once by the first revision and never changes. Readers take
  the earliest of any snapshot's recorded `created` and the `wall` of the
  earliest known revision by `(hlc, device, seq)`.
- `paper.kind` ∈ `blank`, `ruled`, `grid`, `dot`. Lengths are points (1/72 in).
- `pageSize.infinite: true` means the page grows downward; `height` is then
  the current extent.
- In a snapshot, `pages` are sorted by `(order, id)`.

`State` may carry `"clocks"`, mapping each LWW register (`title`, `tags`,
`notebook`, `favorite`, `paper`, `pageSize`, `deleted`) to the stamp of the
op that last set it, encoded `"<hlc>-<device>"`, e.g.
`{"title": "17596320000000003-a1b2c3d4"}`. A delta the snapshot does not
cover wins a register only if its own `(hlc, device)` is greater than that
stamp; between snapshots, the greater recorded stamp wins. A register with
no clock is treated as stamped by the snapshot's own `(hlc, device)`.

`State` may carry `"tombstones": {"strokes": [uuid, ...], "pages": [uuid, ...]}`.
A delta adding a tombstoned id stays removed. `strokes` lists ids whose
`removeStroke` was seen while the revision that added the stroke was not yet
covered by `included`; once it is covered, the tombstone may be dropped.
`pages` lists every removed page id and is never pruned, so a late op on a
removed page is a no-op rather than an orphan (§5.3). Both fields are
omitted when empty.

### 5.5 Page

```json
{ "id": "…", "order": "a0", "strokes": [ Stroke, ... ] }
```

`order` is any string; pages sort lexicographically by `(order, id)`. The
library provides a helper to generate a key between two neighbours.

In a snapshot, a page may carry `"orderClock"`, the `"<hlc>-<device>"` stamp
of the `addPage` or `setPageOrder` that set its `order`, with the same LWW
rule and default as `clocks` (§5.4).

In a snapshot, every page and stroke carries `"origin"`,
`"<hlc>-<device>-<seq>-<op>"`: the revision that added it and the op's
index in that revision. A snapshot whose `included` covers that revision but
which does not hold the item has seen it removed. Strokes on a page are
ordered by `origin`. An item without `origin` is treated as added by the
snapshot holding it, at op index equal to its position.

### 5.6 Stroke

```json
{
  "id": "…",
  "ink": { "tool": "pen", "color": "#1A1A1AFF", "width": 2.5 },
  "points": [ [x, y, t, w, h, o, f, az, al], ... ],
  "transform": [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  "parent": "…"
}
```

- `tool` ∈ `pen`, `pencil`, `marker`, `monoline`, `fountainPen`,
  `watercolor`, `crayon`. Unknown tools render as `pen`.
- `color` is `#RRGGBBAA`.
- `points` are the control points of a uniform cubic B-spline, exactly as
  PencilKit's `PKStrokePath` exposes them: location `x,y` in points with
  origin top-left and y down; `t` time offset in seconds; `w,h` size in
  points; `o` opacity 0...1; `f` force; `az` azimuth and `al` altitude in
  radians. Writers round to at most 3 decimals.
- `transform` is an optional affine matrix `[a b c d tx ty]`; identity when
  absent.
- `parent` optionally names the stroke this one was sliced from.
- A stroke id is never added again after it has been removed; a writer that
  undoes an erase, or restores from history, must mint a new id and may set
  `parent` to the old one.
- `origin` appears only in snapshots (§5.5).

## 6. Identifiers and encodings

UUIDs are lowercase, hyphenated. Times are RFC 3339 UTC. JSON writers must
not emit NaN or infinities. Numbers in `points` are plain JSON numbers.

## 7. Versioning

`format` in `vault.json` and the body version byte identify the format.
A reader that sees a higher major version must refuse to write and may
offer read-only access if it can parse the files.
