            The file (format.md §12) holds each note's title, tags, notebook, flags, page count and searchable
            text, with the names of the revision files it was made from, sealed (AES-256-GCM) under a key
            derived from the vault secret: only the vault's keys open it. It is a hint: a reader uses an entry
            only while the note's revision files are exactly those, and reads the note otherwise. Notes with
            unreadable revisions get no entry. An existing file's entries for unchanged notes are reused, so
            only changed notes are read (and the summary cache, unless --no-cache).

            Once it exists it stays current: every sempere command that unlocks the vault rewrites it when a
            note changed, and sync webdav keeps the server's copy current (or creates it with --web-viewer).
            --out - prints the sealed file; --plaintext writes the JSON content instead (for checks; it holds
            note titles and text in the clear, so it needs --out).
