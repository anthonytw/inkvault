# Changelog

All notable changes to Sempere are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the CLI's version
(`Sources/SempereCLI/Version.swift`) follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
The section for a version is the body of its GitHub Release (`docs/releasing.md`).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Age library: streaming encryption and decryption in constant memory (`AgeEncryptor`,
  `AgeDecryptor`, file-to-file `AgeFile.encrypt` / `decrypt`), header-only rewrap that keeps the
  file key and payload (`AgeFile.rewrapHeader`) and streaming full re-encryption
  (`AgeFile.reencrypt`), for attachments.
- Attachment model types (`docs/format.md` §8; task A0): placed items (text, image, PDF page, and
  unknown kinds kept verbatim), recordings, transcripts, blob references and their six ops. Revisions
  holding them now decode instead of being reported unreadable; they are not merged yet (A1), so
  `snapshot` and `compact` refuse a note that has them rather than drop them.

### Changed

- **Faster vault opening** (#54). Note summaries skip stroke geometry, are read in parallel,
  and are kept in an encrypted per-device cache (`docs/format.md` §10), so a 600-note vault
  lists in about 1.8 s instead of 21 s, and in 0.08 s when nothing changed. `notes list` gains
  `--no-cache`; `search` uses the same fast path. The app closes the unlock sheet as soon as the
  key is accepted, shows "Opening vault: n of m" while the list fills in, shows cached summaries
  at once on a reopen, and always says why the list is empty.

- **Instant reopen and fast note opening in the app** (#56). The note list opens from the
  encrypted local index and only notes whose revision files changed are downloaded and read
  (an iCloud vault no longer re-checks every file on every launch); a file presenter wakes the
  sync for the notes it names, a full validation runs at low priority, and list updates are
  throttled differences. Notes opened before open from an encrypted drawing cache (200 MB,
  least recently used first, deleted with the vault on this device); others are converted off
  the main thread, the strokes on screen first. Revisions decode their stroke points about twice
  as fast (same JSON). Every phase has an os_signpost interval; debug builds log timings to
  `Library/Logs/SemperePerf.log`.
- The app's Markdown export is now "Text (Markdown)": it leads with the recognised text, the
  PDF is optional (off), and it is disabled for notes without recognised text. HTML export is
  CLI-only.

- Licence: GPL-3.0-or-later with an App Store exception (`LICENSE-EXCEPTION`, a GPLv3 section 7
  additional permission). Contributions are licensed under the same terms and certified with a
  DCO sign-off; there is no contributor licence agreement.

## [0.5.0] - TODO(user): date of the first release

First public release of the `sempere` CLI. Everything below was merged before
the first tag; the pull request numbers refer to
[anthonytw/sempere](https://github.com/anthonytw/sempere/pulls).

### Added

- **age v1 encryption**, spec-exact, validated against the C2SP test vectors and
  the reference `age` CLI: X25519 and scrypt recipients, armor, Bech32 keys (#2).
- **Vault format** (`docs/format.md`): append-only note log with hybrid logical
  clock, merge, snapshots and compaction (#3); on-disk layout, body framing with
  per-vault HMAC tag, keys, note store, fixture vault (#6).
- **Rendering** to vector PDF and SVG from PencilKit-style B-splines (#1), and
  pure-Swift PNG export (`export --format png [--dpi N]`) (#13).
- **CLI** `sempere`: `keys`, `vault init/info/recipients/verify`, `notes`, `export`,
  `recover`, `compact`, `snapshot` (#7); `import notability` and `search` (#12);
  `sync webdav` with the built-in WebDAV client (#16). See `docs/cli.md`.
- **Notability importer** for `.note` packages and backup zips, including
  recognised handwriting as page recognition (#8); PDF page stride and page
  counts in the import report (#18); fidelity evaluation of every imported note (#19).
- **History and restore**: restore points per revision, `notes history`,
  `notes restore`, `export --at` (#14).
- **iPad app (in development, not released)**: Xcode project, vault shell and CI (#10);
  vault browser (#15); PencilKit canvas with stable stroke ids and autosave (#17);
  usability pass: a vault as one item in Files, progressive iCloud loading,
  tool palette, rename, tags (#21).
- **Release engineering**: tagged builds publish static Linux (x86_64, aarch64) and
  universal macOS CLI tarballs with `SHA256SUMS` and build provenance
  attestations; Homebrew formula template; CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY and App Store
  preparation docs.
- CI: Linux (`swift:6.4-noble`) and macOS test jobs, static Linux CLI build (#4),
  cloud setup script (#11).

### Fixed

- Render input validation and infinite-page output (#5).
- Two PNG and marker rendering bugs found by the import fidelity evaluation (#19).
- App: debug launch expands `~/` to the app's data container (#20).
